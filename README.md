# Final-project--document-summarization-GAN
This is a proejct for university college london master thesis.  
department of computer science 
Web Science and big data analytics. 


This is a generative adversarial networks used in document summariztaion area. 
The generator is a sequence to sequence model.
Discriminator is a CNN model. 


Run the code:
1) run data_preprocessing_and_vocabulary_bulid
2) run summarizationGAN

When runing the summariztaionGAN, it has several steps: 
1) pre-train the generator
2) decode Â 
3) pre train discriminator
4) run GAN 
5) test generator model 

For using the Jupyter notebook, You need to restart the kernel before each step.
